-got all the atom rows
-calculate the distance between all the atom

Example:
given I have 5 atom,

I will have to compute the length of 5C3 = 10 triangles
5C2 = 10 is enough to get all the necessary combination I need

-able to get all the distance between any two protein and store it in a tuple:distance dictionary
-able to get all the combination of all the triangle
next: map each of the triangle edge with the dictionary
-after getting all the lengths, use cosine rule to find the angle
